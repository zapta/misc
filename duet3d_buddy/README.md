Duet Buddy is a companion M5Stack app for the duet3d controller. It uses
the M5Stack Core hardware with Arduino/ESP32/M5Stack firmware whose
full source code is available here.

The firmware can be uploaded to the M5Stack using the Arduino IDE with the
ESP and M5Stack specific extensions or using the burn script provided in 
the release directory here.

Instructions for installing the Arduino IDE for M5Stack are available in a few
places on the internet. For example here http://community.m5stack.com/topic/161/lesson-1-0-let-s-start-hello-macos/2.
After the instalaltion, create a new arduino project, remove any .ino file that was created automatically
and copy instead the source files from here (.ino, .h, and .cpp extensions). 

If you just want to upload the latest Duet Buddy firmware to your M5Stack Code, use the 
files and script from the release directory here. You may also need to install a serial
driver to allow your computer to talk with the M5Stack code. These drivers are available
here https://m5stack.com/pages/download.
