* Try to eliminate the external EEPROM by storing the settings in internal flash per discussion at https://community.platformio.org/t/how-to-reserve-a-page-of-flash-memory-stm32-arduino/18664

* Consider adding a SD card (SPI connection).

* Make the blackpill's builtin 'key' button available to whatever we want.

* Explore if we can get good refresh rate and user experience with a 320x240 TFT / Resistive touch (cheap) and dual buffering SPI + DMA.

* Can we have a RPI pico base version? Having two cores may allow parallel render/tft-update.
